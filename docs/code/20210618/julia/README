This directory contains the Julia code used for the experiments in
our paper "Posets with Interfaces for Concurrent Kleene Algebra".

Julia 1.6 or greater is required.  No installation is necessary, except
for the Julia packages LightGraphs and Combinatorics.  If these are not
present, Julia will complain when called the first time and tell you
how to install them.

LightPosets.jl and iposets.jl are general libraries implementing posets
and iposets. generate.jl contains the code used to generate different
types of posets and iposets.
