    We present a recent line of work on open games, which describe

    Markov decision processes.  This is done by adding open ends that

    adequate syntactic and semantic categories, we can then write
    algorithms that can leverage compositionality to compute faster
    solutions when there are repeated sub-games.<br />
    
    Here, we show the categorical machinery at work in the definition

    some particularities that arise in the case of open Markov
    decision processes (OMDPs).  Our goal is to understand our main

  Reporting on recent joint work with Nicolas Behr and Noam
  Zeilberger, I will describe the rabbit calculus, a convolution
  product over preasheaves of double categories motivated by term and
  graph rewriting theory. As I will explain, the convolution product
  generalizes to every double category the usual Day tensor product of
  presheaves of monoidal categories. One interesting aspect of the
  construction is that this convolution product is in general only
  oplax associative. For that reason, several classes of double
  categories will be identified for which the convolution product is
  not just oplax associative, but fully associative. This includes in
  particular framed bicategories on the one hand, and double
  categories of term and graph rewriting theories on the other. For
  the latter, we establish a formula which justifies the view that the
  convolution product categorifies the rule algebra product, and
  captures the basic intuitions of causality in rewriting theory.

  There is an intricate link between concurrent systems and homotopy

  between computation and homotopy theory goes even further and my
  long-term goal is to develop a general theory of higher coalgebras

  provides an abstract account of this link. (∞, 1)-categories have
  various models, among them topologically and simplicially enriched
  categories. These are quite rigid models but they lend themselves to
  concrete computations (see Lurie's Higher Topos Theory).<br />

  In this talk, I will first present some results on coalgebras that

  distributive laws, modal logic and effectful computations. We will
  then go into the concrete case of topologically-enriched categories
  to develop some homotopy theory of coalgebras in this concrete

  I will present two invariants which, to a category C, associate
  functors pi_0(C/-), pi_1(C/-) defined on C with values in the
  category of pointed posets. These generalise the pi_0 and pi_1 of a
  groupoid in the sense that, if C is a groupoid and x an object in C,
  pi_0(C/x) and pi_1(C/x) are discrete posets isomorphic,
  respectively, to the set of connected components of C and to the
  underlying set of the group of automorphisms of x.<br />
  Their main property is that they "vanish" precisely on terminal
  objects in C: that is, pi_0(C/x) and pi_1(C/x) are both
  single-element posets if and only if x is a terminal object in C. In
  this sense, any element of pi_0(C/x) and pi_1(C/x) besides the
  basepoint may be seen as an "obstruction to x being terminal".<br />
  After giving the definition of the invariants, I will explore some
  of their properties more in depth: in what ways they are functorial,
  and under what conditions the posets are endowed with extra
  properties or structures, such as the existence of joins or a
  monoidal structure.<br />

  Relational structures based on acyclic relations capturing the

  more general concurrent behaviours. However, in each of these cases,

  instantaneously. We will try to remove this restriction and consider
  executions modelled by interval orders, where actions are assumed to
  be executed non-instantaneously. For this execution model, we will

  <div style="display:none", id="Helouet">
  In Time Petri nets (TPNs), time and control are tightly connected:
  time measurement for a transition starts only when all resources
  needed to fire it are available. For many systems, one wants to
  start measuring time as soon as a part of the preset of a transition
  is filled, and fire it after some delay and when all needed
  resources are available.<br />

  This work considers an extension of TPN called waiting nets
  decoupling time measurement and control. Their semantics ignores
  urgency when upper bounds of intervals are reached but some
  resources needed to fire are not yet available. Firing of a
  transition is then allowed as soon as missing resources become
  available.  This semantics extension resembles stopwatches, but is
  in fact weaker.<br />

  It is known that extending bounded TPNs with stopwatches leads to
  undecidability. Our extension is weaker, and bounded Waiting nets
  are not Turing powerful.  Interestingly, state classes, a standard
  technique to build a finite abstract representation of the sate
  space and analyze bounded time Petri nets extends to waiting nets.
  We show how to compute a finite state class graph for bounded
  waiting nets, yielding decidability of reachability and
  coverability. We then compare expressiveness of waiting nets with
  that of other models and show that they are strictly more expressive
  than TPNs.

  We propose a categorical framework for bisimulations and unfoldings

  and unfoldings. This is based on a notion of categories accessible
  with respect to a subcategory of path shapes, i.e., for which one
  can define a nice notion of trees as glueings of paths. We show that
  transition systems and presheaf models are instances of our
  framework. We also prove that in our framework, several notions of
  bisimulation coincide, in particular an ‶operational one” akin to
  the standard definition in transition systems. Also, our notion of
  accessibility is preserved by coreflections. This also leads us to a
  notion of unfolding that behaves well in the accessible case: it is
  a right adjoint and is a universal covering, i.e., it is initial
  among the morphisms that have the unique lifting property with
  respect to path shapes. As an application, we prove that the
  universal covering of a groupoid, a standard construction in
  algebraic topology, is an unfolding, when the category of path
  shapes is well chosen.  Joint work with Éric and Jean Goubault.

  We provide a unified and elementary proof of both properties. In
  contrast with earlier completeness proofs, this proof does not rely
  on minimality or bisimilarity techniques for deterministic
  automata. Instead, our approach avoids deterministic automata
  altogether, and uses Antimirov's derivatives and the well-known
  transition monoid construction.<br />

  Towards the end, we will offer some thoughts on whether or not these
  techniques can be generalized to attack the open completeness
  problem for downward-closed series-parallel rational expressions.

  <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('Amrane')">Series-parallel pomsets: automata and logic</a>
  <div style="display:none", id="Amrane">
    In order to model concurrency, Lodaya and Weil extended
    automata theory from the usual word languages to sets of labelled
    series-parallel posets (pomset) languages. These languages are
    subsets of SP($A$): the smallest class containing the empty
    pomset, the letters of $A$ and being closed under sequential
    product (concatenation) and parallel product, or equivalently, the
    class of posets labelled by the alphabet $A$, having finite
    antichains and not containing four distinct elements $x$, $y$,
    $z$, $t$ whose relative order form an N: $x < y$, $z < y$ and $z <
    t$.<br />

    In this talk we focus on a Kleene-like theorem and a
    Büchi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot-like theorem on languages of
    SP($A$). Lodaya and Weil introduced a notion of branching
    automata. It is a generalization of Kleene automata with two new
    types of transitions: fork and join transitions, in addition to
    the usual sequential transitions of Kleene automata. The fork
    transitions allow to execute concurrently a finite number of
    instruction flows and the join transitions merge them. These
    automata accept subsets of SP($A$) of unbounded width.  Lodaya and
    Weil introduced a generalization of the usual rational expressions
    to catch the expressivity of branching automata. These two
    equivalent models can be restricted to both accept, in an
    equivalent way, subsets of SP($A$) of bounded width.<br />

    From a logical point of view, Kuske showed that a rational
    language of SP($A$) is of bounded width if and only if it is
    definable in monadic second order (MSO) logic. However, MSO alone
    does not suffice for rational languages of unbounded width.  The
    finite parallel iteration is not MSO-definable. Bedon introduced
    P-MSO, which is monadic second order mixed with Presburger
    arithmetic. He shows that the languages of branching automata are
    exactly those definable in P-MSO logic. As a consequence, the
    P-MSO theory of SP($A$) is decidable.

  <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('Rajsbaum')">Unifying concurrent objects and distributed tasks: interval-linearizability</a>
  <div style="display:none", id="Rajsbaum">
    Tasks and objects are two predominant ways of specifying
    distributed problems where processes should compute outputs based
    on their inputs. Roughly speaking, a task specifies, for each set
    of processes and each possible assignment of input values, they're
    valid outputs. In contrast, an object is defined by a sequential
    specification. Also, an object can be invoked multiple times by
    each process, while a task is a one-shot problem. Each one
    requires its own implementation notion, stating when an execution
    satisfies the specification. For objects, linearizability is
    commonly used, while tasks implementation notions are less
    explored.<br />

    The talk overviews results presented in JACM 2018 together with
    Castañeda and Raynal, about the notion of interval-sequential
    object, and the corresponding implementation notion of
    interval-linearizability, to encompass many problems that have no
    sequential specification as objects.  A main result of the article
    is that interval-sequential objects and (refined) tasks have the
    same expressive power and both are complete in the sense that they
    are able to specify any prefix-closed set of well-formed
    executions.

  <div style="display:none", id="Zouari">
    The categorical approach of Nielsen & Winskel came up with a
    unifying understanding of models of concurrency. Previous
    applications of this method to higher dimensional automata (HDA)
    have not treated the logic that it yields in much detail. In this
    work, we follow the same approach to introduce a new notion of
    Bisimulation from open maps and its characteristic path
    logic. Further, we investigate fragments of the logic and the
    bisimulations that they capture. To this end, we rely on the
    recent categorical definition of HDA and the notion of track
    objects. The motivation for this study is to develop modal
    characterization for all concurrency bisimulations.
