  <strong><a href="https://www.matem.unam.mx/~rajsbaum/">Sergio Rajsbaum</a></strong>,
  UNAM, Mexico and IRIF, Paris, France:
  <strong>Unifying concurrent objects and distributed tasks: Interval-linearizability</strong><br />

  Tasks and objects are two predominant ways of specifying distributed
  problems where processes should compute outputs based on their
  inputs. Roughly speaking, a task specifies, for each set of
  processes and each possible assignment of input values, they’re
  valid outputs. In contrast, an object is defined by a sequential
  specification. Also, an object can be invoked multiple times by each
  process, while a task is a one-shot problem. Each one requires its
  own implementation notion, stating when an execution satisfies the
  specification. For objects, linearizability is commonly used, while
  tasks implementation notions are less explored.<br />

  The talk overviews results presented in JACM 2018 together with
  Castañeda and Raynal, about the notion of interval-sequential
  object, and the corresponding implementation notion of
  interval-linearizability, to encompass many problems that have no
  sequential specification as objects.  A main result of the article
  is that interval-sequential objects and (refined) tasks have the
  same expressive power and both are complete in the sense that they
  are able to specify any prefix-closed set of well-formed executions.

  NTNU Gjøvik, Norway:
  <strong>Logical characterization of hh-bisimulation via open maps for HDA</strong><br />
  
  The categorical approach of Nielsen & Winskel came up with a
  unifying understanding of models of concurrency. Previous
  applications of this method to higher dimensional automata (HDA)
  have not treated the logic that it yields in much detail. In this
  work, we follow the same approach to introduce a new notion of
  Bisimulation from open maps and its characteristic path
  logic. Further, we investigate fragments of the logic and the
  bisimulations that they capture. To this end, we rely on the recent
  categorical definition of HDA and the notion of track objects. The
  motivation for this study is to develop modal characterization for
  all concurrency bisimulations.
