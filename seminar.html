  <strong>Completeness and the finite model property for Kleene algebra, reconsidered</strong><br />

  Kleene Algebra (KA) is the algebra of regular expressions. Central
  to the study of KA is Kozen's (1994) completeness result, which says
  that any equivalence valid in the language model of KA follows from
  the axioms of KA. Also of interest is the finite model property
  (FMP), which says that false equivalences always have a finite
  counterexample. Palka (2005) showed that, for KA, the FMP is
  equivalent to completeness.

  We provide a unified and elementary proof of both properties. In
  contrast with earlier completeness proofs, this proof does not rely
  on minimality or bisimilarity techniques for deterministic
  automata. Instead, our approach avoids deterministic automata
  altogether, and uses Antimirov's derivatives and the well-known
  transition monoid construction.

  Towards the end, we will offer some thoughts on whether or not these
  techniques can be generalized to attack the open completeness
  problem for downward-closed series-parallel rational expressions.

  <strong>Logics and automata for Message Sequence Charts</strong><br />

  Message sequence charts (MSCs) are partial orders representing
  executions of message-passing systems. They arise as executions of
  communicating automata, in which a fixed number of finite-state
  processes communicate through FIFO channels: Where a standard finite
  automaton defines a language of words, communicating automata define
  languages of MSCs. In this talk, I will give an overview of
  different formalisms that can be used to specify sets of MSCs, and
  explain how fundamental results from formal language theory such as
  the Büchi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot theorem can be extended to MSCs.

  <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('Amrane')">Series-parallel pomsets: automata and logic</a>
  <div style="display:none", id="Amrane">
    In order to model concurrency, Lodaya and Weil extended
    automata theory from the usual word languages to sets of labelled
    series-parallel posets (pomset) languages. These languages are
    subsets of SP($A$): the smallest class containing the empty
    pomset, the letters of $A$ and being closed under sequential
    product (concatenation) and parallel product, or equivalently, the
    class of posets labelled by the alphabet $A$, having finite
    antichains and not containing four distinct elements $x$, $y$,
    $z$, $t$ whose relative order form an N: $x < y$, $z < y$ and $z <
    t$.<br />

    In this talk we focus on a Kleene-like theorem and a
    Büchi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot-like theorem on languages of
    SP($A$). Lodaya and Weil introduced a notion of branching
    automata. It is a generalization of Kleene automata with two new
    types of transitions: fork and join transitions, in addition to
    the usual sequential transitions of Kleene automata. The fork
    transitions allow to execute concurrently a finite number of
    instruction flows and the join transitions merge them. These
    automata accept subsets of SP($A$) of unbounded width.  Lodaya and
    Weil introduced a generalization of the usual rational expressions
    to catch the expressivity of branching automata. These two
    equivalent models can be restricted to both accept, in an
    equivalent way, subsets of SP($A$) of bounded width.<br />

    From a logical point of view, Kuske showed that a rational
    language of SP($A$) is of bounded width if and only if it is
    definable in monadic second order (MSO) logic. However, MSO alone
    does not suffice for rational languages of unbounded width.  The
    finite parallel iteration is not MSO-definable. Bedon introduced
    P-MSO, which is monadic second order mixed with Presburger
    arithmetic. He shows that the languages of branching automata are
    exactly those definable in P-MSO logic. As a consequence, the
    P-MSO theory of SP($A$) is decidable.

  <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('Rajsbaum')">Unifying concurrent objects and distributed tasks: interval-linearizability</a>
  <div style="display:none", id="Rajsbaum">
    Tasks and objects are two predominant ways of specifying
    distributed problems where processes should compute outputs based
    on their inputs. Roughly speaking, a task specifies, for each set
    of processes and each possible assignment of input values, they're
    valid outputs. In contrast, an object is defined by a sequential
    specification. Also, an object can be invoked multiple times by
    each process, while a task is a one-shot problem. Each one
    requires its own implementation notion, stating when an execution
    satisfies the specification. For objects, linearizability is
    commonly used, while tasks implementation notions are less
    explored.<br />

    The talk overviews results presented in JACM 2018 together with
    Castañeda and Raynal, about the notion of interval-sequential
    object, and the corresponding implementation notion of
    interval-linearizability, to encompass many problems that have no
    sequential specification as objects.  A main result of the article
    is that interval-sequential objects and (refined) tasks have the
    same expressive power and both are complete in the sense that they
    are able to specify any prefix-closed set of well-formed
    executions.

  <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('Zouari')">Logical characterization of hh-bisimulation via open maps for HDA</a>
  <div style="display:none", id="Zouari">
    The categorical approach of Nielsen & Winskel came up with a
    unifying understanding of models of concurrency. Previous
    applications of this method to higher dimensional automata (HDA)
    have not treated the logic that it yields in much detail. In this
    work, we follow the same approach to introduce a new notion of
    Bisimulation from open maps and its characteristic path
    logic. Further, we investigate fragments of the logic and the
    bisimulations that they capture. To this end, we rely on the
    recent categorical definition of HDA and the notion of track
    objects. The motivation for this study is to develop modal
    characterization for all concurrency bisimulations.
