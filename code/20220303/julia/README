This directory contains the Julia code used for the experiments in
our paper "Generating Posets with Interfaces".

Julia 1.6 is required.  No installation is necessary, except for the
Julia packages LightGraphs and Combinatorics.  If these are not
present, Julia will complain when called the first time and tell you
how to install them.

LightPosets.jl and iposets.jl are general libraries implementing
posets and iposets. closures.jl contains the code used to generate
different types of posets and iposets, analysis.jl contains functions
for analysing (arrays of) (i)posets, and count.jl contains code for
analysing the isomorphism check.
