This directory contains the Python code used for the experiments in
our paper "Generating posets beyond N".

Python 3 is required.  No installation is necessary.

poset.py and iposet.py are general libraries implementing posets and
iposets. ramics.py contains the code used to perform the different
experiments.

allposets.py, spposets.py and gpposets.py are command-line programs
which can be used directly to count the numbers of posets, sp-posets,
and gp-posets on a fixed number of points (which is given as input).
