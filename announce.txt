it seems the p-acts mailing list is currently broken, so I'm sending this announcement the old way, in a personal email.

We are organizing a workshop at ENS Paris-Saclay and Ã‰cole polytechnique 11-12 September, directly after P-ACTS (but not in the same place):

    https://ulifahrenberg.github.io/pomsets/3/

Please register before 1 September in case you are interested, at

    https://framadate.org/eE6Bm4EqOkrtEw9q

If you want to give a talk, please indicate so during registration and get back to us so that we can discuss title & abstract etc.

Cheers,
for the organizers,
Uli Fahrenberg
