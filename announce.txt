you may be one of the many people who tried, in vain, to attend the special Christmas session of the (i)Po(m)set Project Online Seminar yesterday.  The zoom link I had sent in the announcement, and repeated in the reminder, was wrong.  Additionally, I was not available to try to fix things when they broke, and our host Krzysztof Ziemiański had no access to my data and could not do anything.

I am sorry for the distress this has caused, both to the people who tried to attend but especially to our speaker Mikołaj Bojańczyk and to Krzysztof.  We will make some organisational changes to minimize the likelihood of any further such disasters.

I am thankful to be able to report that Mikołaj has already agreed to postpone his talk to another friday, most probably in January.  I will keep you posted.  Until then, I wish you happy holidays and hope to see you on zoom in January.
